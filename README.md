Please read this before trying to use Magic 8-Ball

Also, please note: I no longer provide PyInstaller links
due to slow load times and other issues. I will no longer
support these either.

**** Installation: ****

This download should've come with 3 Files, and 1 Folder
The files should be named: magic8ball.py, requirements.txt
and README.md The folder should be named assets.
Do not move any of the folders or rename files, as this can
cause unintended behaviour.

1. Install the dependancies:
Open "cmd" or a Terminal Emulator and type "python -M pip install requirements.txt"
This will install the dependancies.

2. Enjoy.

Reporting issues:
I do not provide any support. But if you are having problems,
feel free to message be on Discord. I'm happy to help.
